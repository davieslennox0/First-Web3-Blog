    <h1>Welcome To My First Blog On Web3, Deployed Using Fleek</h1>
    <b>Hello viewer, I'm Favour, my friends call me <b>Peruzzi</b>, how I got this name is just funny, do not worry, it is a story for another day.
    Back in 2016, after I graduated from Secondary School in 2015, I dived into programming and my focus was on HTML, not knowing something greater than that exist, so I made a wake up call to myself and I decided to learn Python, it was cool and I was understanding every bit of it, suddenly, I puffed, everything collapsed, I lost total interest in the tech world.
    Funny how things work, I created a blog then, from scratch using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, when my mates where using CMS, I decided to challenge myself and wrote the codes myself, was feeling fly then, my friends was jealous, deep down inside, I know I have not done anything.
    Wrote JAMB thrice was not admitted, applied to study Mechatronics Engineering, Electrical Electronics Engineering and Agricultural enginnering, none of them worked out. I have applied several schools, the likes of Petroleum Traning Institute, Effurun Warri, Federal University Oye, Federal University of Technology, Owerri,
    University of Benin, of which I later changed to Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, where I am studying Environmental Management and Toxicology.
</p>

<p>I know you would love to hear more about me, but do not worry, you will have to book a ticket, pass protocols before you get to see me.
    I am still in my making mode. This strike came for a reason, I was studying Python on Wednesday night, around 01:34, my eyes where closing, I smiled and said how have the mighty fallen, remebered when I do not sleep at all, writing bunch of codes, did not sleep for 48hrs, trying build a blog from scratch for deployment.
    Know what? I am building myself to back to that state again, me in my room, facing my laptop, ear piece plugged in with a bowl of gum just beside me.
    I have done so many shits in tech world, helped develop an e-commerce site, built one for a client, designed several sites both for clients, family and friends, it is time to do mine!
</p>

<p><h2>NEXT PROJECT IS GOING TO BE HUGE, WORLDWIDE USAGE, TOKENIZED WEBSITE, HOSTED ON IPFS & ICP, DEPLOYED ON BLOCKCHAIN AND WEB3.</h2></p>
    </div>

    <p>The blog prolly looks like ordinary, discovered Fleek 3 hours ago and did not know what to do 
        so I decided to make write this and upload on Git, link my repo to Fleek and DEPLOY!
